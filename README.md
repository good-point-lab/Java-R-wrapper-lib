DataAnalysis
============

A Java-based example for building data analysis tools

Introduction

This is a project-skeleton for configuration and integration of components related to data analysis.  It utilizes the Spring framework, R engine,  JDBC/ORM data access, and RESTful web services.  The code is functional, but in essence it is a starting point to build upon.  Support for Hadoop framework will follow.

Details

The code is developed in NetBeans IDE and tested with Tomcat server, R Rserve package, and MySql DB.  For test data, R Iris dataset is used.   It could be loaded to the DB with one of the supplyed unit tests.   Before loading create a table decribed in the unit test.  Also edit the properties and log configuration files accordingly.
