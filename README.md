Java-based data analysis scaffolding

Introduction

This is a project template for configuring and integrating data analysis components. It utilizes the Spring framework, R engine, JDBC/ORM data access, Hadoop clients, and RESTful web services. The code is functional, but in essence it is a starting point to build upon.

Details

The code is developed in the NetBeans IDE and tested with Tomcat server, R Rserve package, and MySql. For test data, the R Iris dataset is used. It can be loaded into the DB with one of the supplied unit tests. Before loading, create a table as specified in the SQL script. Also, edit the properties and log configuration files accordingly.
